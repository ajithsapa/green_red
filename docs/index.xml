However, it was only an inspiration. The neural networks are limited by the current computing architecture. Whatever developments we have seen after the initial inspiration have not been brain-inspired (not that it is mandatory). There is so much more inspiration to take from the brain which can lead to exponentially more powerful AI.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://ajithsapa.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ajithsapa.github.io/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my personal website! I’m Ajith, and I’m passionate about AI, sustainability, and the intersections of technology, society, and business. My academic journey started in physics, where I explored astrophysics during my bachelor’s and master’s studies. Later, I pursued a PhD in computational neuroscience, where I researched how communication patterns of individual neurons can influence brain states. I also had the opportunity to apply these computational techniques to urban geography during my PhD.</description></item></channel></rss>
