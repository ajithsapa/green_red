      <description>Human brain served as the inspiration for neural networks that form the bedrock of the exciting applications we now see in the field of AI. However, it was only an inspiration. The neural networks are limited by the current computing architecture. Whatever developments we have seen after the initial inspiration have not been brain-inspired (not that it is mandatory). There is so much more inspiration to take from the brain which can lead to exponentially more powerful AI.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal website! I’m Ajith, and I’m passionate about AI, sustainability, and the intersections of technology, society, and business. My academic journey started in physics, where I explored astrophysics during my bachelor’s and master’s studies. Later, I pursued a PhD in computational neuroscience, where I researched how communication patterns of individual neurons can influence brain states. I also had the opportunity to apply these computational techniques to urban geography during my PhD.</description>
