Welcome to my personal website! I’m Ajith, and I’m passionate about AI, sustainability, and the intersections of technology, society, and business. My academic journey started in physics, where I explored astrophysics during my bachelor’s and master’s studies. Later, I pursued a PhD in computational neuroscience, where I researched how communication patterns of individual neurons can influence brain states. I also had the opportunity to apply these computational techniques to urban geography during my PhD.

After completing my studies, I founded Ongil, a startup focused on making sense of limited data and providing comprehensive insights. Over time, our focus has evolved towards using AI to help companies navigate their sustainability actions. 

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to drop me a note at ajithsapa at gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (search for Ajith Sahasranamam).
